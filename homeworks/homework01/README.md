# Homework 1

This homework will create a new public repository on in your GitHub account. Additionally, you should submit answers to problems 1-5 in GitHub Classroom as specified in _italics_.

## Problem 1

**10 points**

Make a GitHub account and populate your bio. Here's an example [github.com/trvrb/](https://github.com/trvrb/).

_Submit the link to your GitHub profile._

## Problem 2

**10 points**

Make a new project directory using the `messy-project-directory/`, ie copy the contents of this folder to a new directory on your computer. You can download the course files with the following link: [github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/archive/master.zip). Rename this directory to `tfcb-homework01`.

Open GitHub Desktop and make a "New repository" with name `tfcb-homework01` from this `tfcb-homework01` directory, ie set "Local Path" to point at your local `tfcb-homework01` directory.

Create an initial commit that adds all the local files in `tfcb-homework01`:
- `Survey Data.xlsx`
- `get Species_list.py`
- etc...

_Nothing to submit to GitHub Classroom._

## Problem 3

**10 points**

Publish `tfcb-homework01` to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. Make sure to set this to be a "public" repository. The resulting repository can now be accessed at github.com/{your_name}/tfcb-homework01. If necessary, you can make this repository public by going to "Settings" from this page.

_Submit link to your public repository._

## Problem 4

**10 points**

Organize files into a more consistent structure. Group images into a `images/` directory. Separate source code and data. Rename files to remove spaces and improve consistency.

Commit changes and publish to your public GitHub repository.

_Submit the commit URL that effects these changes, ie the equivalent of https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/commit/16b5235bd2d908c96f22297813e6aaf9f172ad41. You can find these URLs by clicking on "commits" from your project page on GitHub._

## Problem 4

**10 points**

Create a file called `README.md` and populate with Markdown. Demonstrate headers, lists, links, embedded images (by linking to images contained in the directory) and tables in this readme.

Commit this file and publish to your public GitHub repository.

_Submit link to README.md file on GitHub._

## Problem 5

**10 points**

Clean up the file that was originally named `Survey Data.xlsx`. Some points to remember: aim for a single tidy data frame in a single tab, don't use formatting as data, use preferred date format, properly record null values.

Export this as a tab-delimited `.tsv` text file with Unix line endings.

Commit the modified `.xlsx` file and the `.tsv` file and publish to your public GitHub repository.

_Submit link to the `.tsv` file on GitHub._
