# Homework 5: Intro to Python

The assignment includes material from lectures 9 and 12. It is due on Thursday, November 7 at noon through GitHub Classroom. The assignment is worth 50 points (plus 5 extra credit points), with partial credit possible (this is more likely if you include code comments so we understand your intentions).

If you have difficulty viewing this notebook in GitHub, copy the URL to the page and paste it into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to render.

This assignment uses output from a genomic analysis. Because the instructions for each question describe the desired output in relation to the specific data provided, you should not need a deep understanding of the specific data to complete the assigned exercises.

**Instructions:**
- Clone the repository created when you accept the invitation from GitHub Classroom
- Add your code to the notebook to answer each question. Please note that your notebook needs to contain the `data` directory in order for the included code to run.
- Take advantage of the code chunks included at the bottom of the page!
- Make sure your entire notebook is executable, and has been executed in order (in the "Cell" menu, select "Run All")
