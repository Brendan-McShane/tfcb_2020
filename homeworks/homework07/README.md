# Homework 7: Python data analysis and remote computing

This assignment includes material from lectures 15 and 16 (Python data analysis and modeling) as well as lectures 17 and 18 (remote computing). It is due on Thursday, December 5 at noon through GitHub Classroom.

Point values are listed with each question, and the assignment is worth 80 points total.

Don't forget to include references to the sources you used to obtain your answer, including your classmates (if you are working in groups). A failure to include code comments and to cite your sources (if applicable) will result in a reduction in your grade.

**Instructions:**
- Clone the repository created when you accept the invitation from GitHub Classroom
- Complete questions from each of the two sections:
  - [`homework07python.ipynb`](homework07python.ipynb): Add your code to the notebook to answer each question. Prior to final submission, make sure your entire notebook is executable, and has been executed in order (in the "Cell" menu, select "Run All").
  - [`homework07unix.md`](homework07unix.md): Replace the text where indicated with code and answers.
