# Software installation

Please follow the instructions below to install the required software for this course. We'll use the other files in this directory to test the software together in class. The tools you'll need include:

- [Git and GitHub](#git) for version control
- [R and RStudio](#r) for R statistical programming
- [Jupyter Notebooks via Anaconda](#python) for Python

## Git

Git is version control software, which helps you keep track of changes made to files. GitHub is a repository for data and code tracked with Git, and is a mechanism for publishing and collaborating on project development.

If you do not already have one, please register for a GitHub account. Please note that your name and email will be publicly visible through GitHub by default, but more information on controlling privacy settings can be found here.
The website for GitHub Desktop should auto-detect your operating system and allow you to download and install the software.

## R

R and RStudio are separate downloads.
R is the "engine", while RStudio is an integrated desktop environment (IDE) that makes using R much more pleasant.
R must be installed before RStudio.
Follow the instructions below for your operating system to install them.
If you are working on a computer owned by Fred Hutch,
RStudio + R is available through the Self Service application.

### Windows

- Download the installer for the latest version of R from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
  The file will begin downloading automatically.
- Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the prompts to install.
- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
- Under _Installers_, click the link for the _Windows Vista/7/8/10_ installer to download it.
- Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the prompts to install (default options are acceptable).
- Once both are installed, launch RStudio and make sure there are no error messages.

### macOS

- Download the installer for the latest version of R compatible with your version of macOS from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
  If you are not using a recent version of macOS you may have to scroll down to _Binaries for legacy OS X systems_ and find the one appropriate for your version of macOS.
  To check what version of macOS you are using, click the apple icon in the upper left corner of your screen and go to _About This Mac_.
  Please note the instructions on that page for downloading and installing [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) if necessary.
- Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the prompts to install (default options are acceptable).
- Go the the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
- Under _Installers_, click the link for the your OSX version's installer to download it.
- Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file, then open the RStudio folder that appears on your desktop. Drag the RStudio icon into the Applications folder.
- Once everything is installed, launch RStudio and make sure there are no error messages.

## Python

We will use [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) to record code, output, and text throughout the course.
We recommend installing Python using Anaconda,
which includes Jupyter notebooks and most of the other packages we'll use for the course, according to the following instructions:
- Download the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) installer for
Python 3.x for your particular operating system.
- Double-click the downloaded file and follow the prompts to install Anaconda (default options are acceptable).
- For assistance troubleshooting installation, please go [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
