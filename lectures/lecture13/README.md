# Lecture 5: Principles of Data Visualization

Now that we can create basic plots in R, we'll talk more about best practices in data visualization: how are data best represented in a graph? How do we select colors and fonts to effectively convey information? What are the main goals of data visualization? This lecture will provide you with the foundational knowledge you need to continue adapting your code to suit the message conveyed by a visualization.

## Learning objectives

- Identify best practices (and common pitfalls) for data visualization
- Differentiate among different types of data visualization
- Apply strategies for effective data visualization

## Class materials

- To view slides in presentation mode, update the repo on your local computer (`git pull origin master`) and open [`lecture.html`](lecture.html) in a web browser. Note that Github does not display `.html` files natively, so you need to open the [`lecture.html`](lecture.html) version that is on your hard disk (You can first browse to its location using your file explorer). [`lecture.org`](lecture.org) and [`reveal.js`](reveal.js) include the unformatted code and files used to create the slides; you should not need to use any of these files.
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke is a great book that describes the concepts behind this lecture in more detail.
