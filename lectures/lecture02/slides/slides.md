* "native" environment for interacting with linux
* similar environments also appear on Mac OS and Windows

# the command line is the computational lab bench

# Command line versus shell

You can write a program to execute command line calls, this is called a "shell script"

# The simplest shell script

# When to use shell programming?

* Very rarely
* When you are only running other commands, like making a simple computational pipeline

# Unix philosophy

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

# a silly demo



# goals

* rudiments of running a command in shell
* how to run a command in parallel across cores
