# Command line versus shell

* The "command line" is the interactive means of interacting with the "shell", which is how you interact with the actual computer
* One can also use shell for (light) programming involving heavy interaction with the computing system

# The simplest shell script

# When to use shell programming?

* Very rarely
* When you are only running other commands, like making a simple computational pipeline

# Unix philosophy

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

# a silly demo



# goals

* rudiments of running a command in shell
* how to run a command in parallel across cores
