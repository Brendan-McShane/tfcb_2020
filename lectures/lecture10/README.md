# Lecture 10

## Learning objectives

After this section, you should be able to:
- Write and execute Python code using Jupyter notebooks
- Manipulate basic data types and structures in Python
- Apply the general programming structures of for loops and defining functions
- Work with Python modules and system commands 

## Class materials

- We'll be using Jupyter notebooks as our interface for Python, so we recommend installing [Anaconda](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/tree/master/software#python) (this also installs many of the other packages we'll be using in Python this semester).
- The content for this lecture (as well as lecture 11) is contained in the Jupyter notebook [`lecture10.ipynb`](lecture10.ipynb) located in this directory. The example code and practice exercises are executable as code cells in that notebook. For additional background on Jupyter notebooks, please see [this link](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).
