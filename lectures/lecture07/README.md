# Lecture 7: Introduction to Sequencing Data Analysis

Sequencing of nucleic acids is almost ubiquitous in biological research. In this lecture, we will introduce some common resources for depositing and retrieving sequence data generated by consortium efforts and independent laboratories. We will introduce concepts and practical steps of querying, inspecting, and visualizing sequence data. Then, we will cover the types of genomic variation and common tools used to predict these. 

This lecture will be largely based on introduction of concepts and will include examples with real data and code. The code is mostly for tools used in the command line and are provided for your reference; this will not be included in the homework for this section. 

## Learning Objectives

1. Sequence data
- Databases and online resources for sequence data
- Learn the common sequence data file formats

2. Tools for sequencing data
- Tools to query, inspect, visualize an aligned sequence file 
- Learn the contents of sequence data files
- Learn to generate sequencing metrics and to process sequence data
- Learn about Python and R libraries/packages to read sequence data 

3. Genome variant analysis
- Types of genomic variation
- Tools to predict genomic variations
- Learn the common file formats for variation data
- Databases and online resources for human variation data

## Class materials

For your reference, data and examples show in this lecture can be downloaded here:
