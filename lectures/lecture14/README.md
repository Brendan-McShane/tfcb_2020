# Lecture 14

This lecture will continue using Python to perform biological sequence analyses.
In particular,, we will use [Biopython](https://biopython.org) to read in sequencing data.
We will also briefly use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for handling data frames, and [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/) for plotting.

## Learning objectives

After this lecture, you should be able to write Python functions:

- Parse barcodes from a real deep-sequencing experiment.

- Convert data into a data frame.

- Plot basic data.

## Class materials

- The content for this lecture is containing in the Jupyter notebook [lecture14.ipynb](lecture14.ipynb) located in this directory.

- Please also install [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/) prior to class by opening Terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and executing the following code: `conda install -c conda-forge plotnine` . Alternatively (on either platform), open Anaconda Navigator, go to "Environments" and click "not installed". Search for plotnine and click the box to install.

## Reminders

- Homework 6 (Practical Python with biopython) is due on Tuesday, November 19 at noon, and includes material from lectures 13 and 14. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/issues/35) for discussion of general questions about the class materials, and [this issue](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/issues/34) for specific questions about homework 6. Kate will hold office hours for homework 6 on Monday, November 20 from 9-11 am in Arnold Atrium.
