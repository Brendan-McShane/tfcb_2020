* Learning Objectives
- Know general dos and donts of data visualization
- Know about different types of data visualization
- Effective strategies for visualization

* Goals of Visualization

- Show experimental design and results
- Show relationships among variables
- Range and interval of a variable
* Same data can be visualized very differently

* Elements of a visualization

- Aesthetics
- Scales
- Labeling
- Exporting

** Aesthetics

[[file:img/common-aesthetics-1.png]]

/(from Wilke 2018)/
** How do you pick aesthetics?

- How many variables and data points do you want to show?
- Is your data continuous or discrete?
- Is there a natural order of discrete variables?


#+BEGIN_NOTES
Do not show more than 5 or 6 discrete categories in a graph.
#+END_NOTES

** Scales
- Linear or log scales
- Axis limits

** Log axes suitable for P-values

[[file:img/dong_2019_crispr_screen.png]]

/(from Dong 2019)/
** Log axes suitable for fold changes 

[[file:img/10xaag_wt_log2.png]]

/(from Park 2019)/
** Log-log plots are common in biology

[[file:img/dong_2019_volcano_plot.png]]

/(from Dong 2019)/
** Labeling

** Exporting
- Vector graphics or bitmap?
- [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]] is a useful open source vector graphics program for assembling figure panels.

* Different types of Data Visualization

Different types of data that we want to visualize:

- Amounts
- Distributions
- Proportions
- X-Y Relationships
- Uncertainty


- Scatter plot
- Line graph
- Bar graph
- Pie charts
- Heat map
- Violin plots
- Bar and whisker plots
- Volcano plots

** Uncertainty
- Error Bars
- Confidence Intervals
