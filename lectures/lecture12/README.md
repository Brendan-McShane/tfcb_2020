# Lecture 4: Visualize data using R/ggplot2

Now that you have a general understanding of project organization and tidy data principles, we're going to get started learning some coding skills. We'll use R (as implemented in the RStudio interface) as our first coding skill to explore this quarter. In general, R is an excellent tool for data manipulation (cleaning, filtering, transforming), analysis (modeling and statistics), and visualization. 

## Learning objectives

- Use the RStudio interface to create R scripts documented with code comments
- Import tabular data into R and create basic data visualizations (scatterplots, line plots) using the R package `ggplot2`

## Class materials

- To view slides in presentation mode, update the repo on your local computer (`git pull origin master`) and open [`lecture.html`](lecture.html) in a web browser. Note that Github does not display `.html` files natively, so you need to open the [`lecture.html`](lecture.html) version that is on your hard disk (You can first browse to its location using your file explorer). [`lecture.org`](lecture.org) and [`reveal.js`](reveal.js) include the unformatted code and files used to create the slides; you should not need to use any of these files.
- Data used in these exercises can be found in [`example_dataset_1.tsv`](data/example_dataset_1.tsv).
- If you would like additional reference material for tasks useful to R, important features of RStudio, and plain-language descriptions of how R works, [Data Carpentry's materials](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) provide additional examples of data manipulation and visualization.

## Reminders

- The due date for Homework 1 was noon on Tuesday, October 8. The final commit from your homework repository was submitted automatically by GitHub Classroom. Grading (scores and comments) will be available in Canvas within one week. Contact Kate (khertwec at fredhutch.org) with any questions or concerns about homework.
