# Lecture 16: Python data analysis with pandas and scikit-learn

## Class materials

- The content for this lecture is contained in the Jupyter notebook [`lecture15.ipynb`](../lecture15/lecture15.ipynb). This is an updated version of the notebook from our last class.

- We recommend making a copy of that notebook (naming it something different, like `my_lecture15.ipynb`), to prevent conflicts when pulling changes for this lecture. If you have git conflicts when pulling for lecture 16, please apply the [methods described here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/blob/master/lectures/lecture14/README.md#class-materials) to discard changes.

## Reminders

- Homework 6 (Practical Python with biopython) was due Tuesday, November 19 at noon.
- Homework 7 will include material from lectures 15-18, and will be available next week.
