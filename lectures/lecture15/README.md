# Lecture 15: Python data analysis with pandas and scikit-learn

This final section on Python will provide more depth to your understanding of the Python packages widely used for statistical and data analysis: pandas, numpy and scikit-learn (all of which come installed with Anaconda!).

## Learning objectives

- Apply functions from `numpy` to manipulate multidimensional numeric data
- Import, manipulate, and visualize data with pandas
- Understand and apply common methods in machine learning using scikit-learn

## Class materials

- The content for this lecture is containing in the Jupyter notebook [`lecture15.ipynb`](lecture15.ipynb) located in this directory.

- We recommend making a copy of that notebook (naming it something different, like `my_lecture15.ipynb`), to prevent conflicts when pulling changes for the next lecture. If you have git conflicts when pulling for lecture 16, please apply the [methods described here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/blob/master/lectures/lecture14/README.md#class-materials) to discard changes.

## Reminders

- Homework 6 (Practical Python with biopython) is due on Tuesday, November 19 at noon, and includes material from lectures 13 and 14. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/issues/35) for discussion of general questions about the class materials, and [this issue](https://github.com/fredhutchio/tfcb_2019/issues/34) for specific questions about homework 6. Kate will hold office hours for homework 6 on Monday, November 20 from 9-11 am in Arnold Atrium.
