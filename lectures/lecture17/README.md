# Lecture 17: Introduction to remote computing

**Erick Matsen ([@ematsen](https://twitter.com/ematsen), [matsen.group](http://matsen.group))**

Now that you have some experience with shell, we'll dive a little more deeply into what remote and cloud computing are, including the modern container-based approach to high-performance computing.
However, we will start by going over some of the questions from last time.

## Learning objectives

After this course, you should be able to:

- Be able to run shell commands from Python
- Understand local versus remote execution
- Understand the basics of what cloud computing is and what it offers
- Understand what a container is and how

## Class materials

This directory has the class materials for the course.
I have added a `quickref.md` quick reference file with basic commands we've used so far.

## Reminders


## Interactive work


* removing, copying, moving, files around on a single machine
* a little about wildcards
* git checkout restores files
* scp; scp -r
* ssh access keys
* uncompressing zip files from the command line
